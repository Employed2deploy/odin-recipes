This repos will be used for the practical exercise in The Odin Project : Recipes.
It will utilize the basics that have thus far been taught for HTML and will be a no-frills recipe website. 
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
The website won't look very pretty by the time it is finished. 
However, we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
